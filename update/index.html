    <h2>What&rsquo;s new in 1.1:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a new <strong>Layer Group</strong> patch, which behaves like the <strong>Render in Image</strong> patch but does not require a <strong>Clear</strong> patch to work properly<br />
        (control-click any <strong>Render in Image</strong> to convert it to a <strong>Layer Group</strong>)</li>
      <li>Added a new <strong>Fill Layer</strong> patch, which lets you quickly fill the screen with a color at an opacity</li>
      <li>Added a new <strong>Progress</strong> patch, which takes a value in a given range and outputs the progress of where the value is in the range</li>
      <li>Added a <strong>Linear Port Connections</strong> feature to the Origami menu (turned on by default) which makes connections easier to read</li>
      <li>Added automatic in-app update checking</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Interaction 2</strong> patch would not work properly with non-center anchor points</li>
      <li>The <strong>Interaction 2</strong> patch now works properly with the <strong>Image with Shadow</strong> patch (and patches built with it including the <strong>Text Layer</strong> patch)</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue with the <strong>Interaction 2</strong> patch where hit regions would be off when in Full Screen mode on a retina display</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue with the <strong>Image Transition</strong> patch that caused the Start and End images to be shown in reverse order</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue that caused the output image of the <strong>Image Transition</strong> patch to be translucent when fading between two fully opaque images</li>
      <li>Added iterator support to the <strong>Switch</strong> patch</li>
      <li>Background colors are no longer applied on text in the <strong>Button</strong> patch</li>
      <li>The <strong>Text Layer</strong> patch now bases its alignment off of its Anchor Position</li>
      <li>Added a <strong>Show/Hide Path Bar</strong> setting to the Editor menu and <strong>Show/Hide Status Bar</strong> setting in the Viewer menu</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue that could cause Quartz Composer to hang momentarily on launch in unfavorable network conditions</li>
      <li>Small improvements to <strong>Value or Default</strong> and <strong>Value to Boolean</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Layer</strong> patches no longer intersect each other when you rotate them</li>
      <li>Fix a crash when adjusting a splitter's type</li>
    </ul>
